# Greetings and Salutations

Dear Reader,

I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read this blog post. I realize that there is a lot of other things that you could be doing at the moment, but the fact that you have taken the time out of your busy schedule to spend a few moments with me does mean a great deal. In this letter of introduction, I intend to tell you a little about myself, and about this website.

## Who am I?
I have been described as a self-taught front-end developer, but I don't think I'm entirely comfortable with that description. My github repository is full of half completed experiments, much in the sane way that a hyper-creative child nay have several art projects strewn about his room in different stages of production. Once I have something finished (possibly this website), I may have it in my heart to call myself a developer.

I have also been described as a teacher or instructor. Once I week, I host a Google Hangout called Mentorship Mondays. On Mentorship Mondays I take an online course that pertains to the field of web development and I discuss it in-depth with other participants. While these events are often structured like a traditional classroom, I'd like to think of them as expeditions into the trends and best practices of our craft. Within this context, I think of myself more as a guide than I do a teacher.

So, who am I? I am someone who loves learning about web development, Linux and Open Source Software. Every day that I discover a new tool or technology, I feel like someone, somewhere has given me a new cool thing to play with. I also like sharing my newfound toys with others. This is done through my writing.


## What is Michael Meets the Web?

Originally, I intended this blog to be an educational resource for beginning to intermediate web developers. It was going to feature tutorials about things like the Linux command-line and Git version control. Then I saw a wealth of well-produced material on the same topics by other content creators. So instead of adding to an oversaturated market, I'd like to focus on my own personal experiences with these technologies instead of lengthy how-to guides.

Granted, I may still write a tutorial or two, but if I choose to go down this path, the subject matter needs to be about technology that for some reason or another was lost in the shuffle. For example, I'd like to write a tutorial on the Metalsmith static site generator, and maybe one on Gulp 4. These are tools I actually have fun using, although they currently live in the shadows of more popular projects like Gatsby and Webpack. 

Additionally, I may write some traditional blog posts about the world of Open Source Software. These will include opinion pieces, attempts at real journalism, and the occasional top ten list. Finally, I may choose to go completely off topic and talk about my other interests which includes (but is not limited to) music, paper and dice roleplaying games, reading and exploring strange new YouTube channels.

## Conclusion
Once again I thank you for dropping in to read this blog post. I really hope that you will enjoy what Michael Meets the Web has to offer, and I hope to see you again real soon.
